# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Objective
Analyze anonymized healthcare data to understand hospital readmission patterns using Python.

## Dataset
- Age group
- Gender
- Length of hospital stay
- Number of medications
- Diagnosis category
- Readmission status

> The dataset was anonymized and used only for learning purposes.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Higher readmission rates observed in older age groups
- Longer hospital stays correlated with increased readmission risk
- Medication count showed a positive relationship with readmission

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of data cleaning, EDA, and visualization in healthcare analytics.
